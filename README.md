## Thinking like a programmer
1. Methodical thinking - more orderly thinking
2. Break problems down - decomposition
3. Think algorithmically - steps to achieve outcome

## Problem solving
1. Define your problem
2. Make sure you've fully understood the problem
3. Break the problem down into small and manageable piece
4. Go as deep as you can until you can get to easy yes or no questions
5. Work yourway up from the bottom until the problem is solved

## TDD
Three types of TDD


· fake it to make it - minimum increment until finished

· obvious implementation - if clear what logic is needed

📜 Context

The team have been working on

which looks to provide a way to get access to protected cloudfront environments via OTS urls generated from our Cookie Cutter Application.

As part of this we’ve re-configured our applications with cookie cutter integration to not be publicly accessible unless Cookie Cutter grants access. This has meant our CI runners which typically interacts with our applications post deployment can no longer test journeys end to end. This ticket looks to ensure our CI can execute successful Smoke Tests (i.e. 200 OK) for our application.

✅ Acceptance Criteria

·        Hello World Smoke Tests validate that the application is successfully deployed.

In Scope

·        Hello world smoke tests

·        Ephemeral environments

Out of Scope

·        DAST tests in Hello World

·        JISA Smoke tests

·        Dev Main Environment

·        DNS verification

 

📐Technical Design

Work to help understand what technical work needs to be carried out on this ticket, you may want to consider, as examples;

·        Scenarios (these should be limited to a particular path, happy, sad, alternative)

·        Sequence Diagrams

·        UML Diagrams

·        C4 Diagrams

·        What security concerns need to be thought about

·        How you may deploy this application (through IaC)

·        What tests you need and how to implement these

·        What technologies you may need

·        Potentially drafting API specifications

·        Potentially drafting ADRs around any decisions

·        Whether or not you first need to answer questions via Spike

·        What dependencies you may have on others
